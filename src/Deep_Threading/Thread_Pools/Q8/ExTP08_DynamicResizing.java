/**
 * DYNAMIC RESIZING THREAD POOL DEMO
 * ---------------------------------
 * Goal:
 *  - Show how a ThreadPoolExecutor can dynamically expand and contract.
 *  - Start with a small core pool (1 thread).
 *  - Submit a burst of tasks â†’ pool grows up to max (8).
 *  - After tasks finish and threads are idle, threads are trimmed
 *    (even core threads) because we enabled core thread timeout.
 *
 * Why it matters:
 *  - Saves resources in real systems where workload is bursty:
 *    scale up when busy, shrink back down when idle.

        // So effectively, the pool shrinks back down to 0 threads.
